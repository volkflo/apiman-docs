<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_api_manager"><a class="anchor" href="#_api_manager"></a>API Manager</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two layers to the API management project. There is an API Manager which allows end users to
centrally manage their APIs. Additionally there is an API Gateway which is responsible for applying those
policies to API requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The API Manager allows end-users to track, configure, and share APIs with other users. All of this is
accomplished by the end user by logging into the API Manager user interface (or using the API Manager
REST API).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_data_model"><a class="anchor" href="#_data_model"></a>Data Model</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is perhaps most important to understand the various entities used by the API Manager, as well as
their relationships with each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_organizations"><a class="anchor" href="#_organizations"></a>Organizations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The top level container concept within the API management project its called the organization. All other
entities are managed within the scope of an organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When users log into the API management system they must be affiliated with one or more organization. Users
can have different roles within that organization allowing them to perform different actions and manage
different entities. Please see the 'User Management' section below for more details on this topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What an organization actually represents will depend upon who is using API management. When installed within
a large enterprise, an organization may represent an internal group within IT (for example the HR group).  If
installed in the cloud, an organization might represent an external company or organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any case, an organization is required before the end user can create or consume APIs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_policies"><a class="anchor" href="#_policies"></a>Policies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important concept in API management is the policy. The policy is the unit of work executed at
runtime in order to implement API governance. All other entities within the API Manager exist in support
of configuring policies and sensibly applying them at runtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a request for an API is made at runtime, a policy chain is created and applied to the inbound request,
prior to proxying that request to the back-end API implementation.  This policy chain consists of policies
configured in the API Manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An individual policy consists of a type (e.g. authentication or rate limiting) as well as configuration
details specific to the type and instance of that policy.  Multiple policies can be configured per API
resulting in a policy chain that is applied at runtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is very important to understand that policies can be configured at three different levels within API
management.  Policies can be configured on an API, on a plan, or on a client app. For more details
please see the sections below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_plans"><a class="anchor" href="#_plans"></a>Plans</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A plan is a set of policies that define a level of service for an API. When an API is consumed it may be
consumed through a plan. Please see the section on 'API Contracts' for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An organization can have multiple plans associated with it. Typically each plan within an organization
consists of the same set of policies but with different configuration details. For example, an organization
might have a Gold plan with a rate limiting policy that restricts consumers to 1000 requests per day. The
same organization may then have a Silver plan which is also configured with a rate limiting policy, but which
restricts consumers to 500 requests per day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a plan has been fully configured (all desired policies added and configured) it must be locked so that
it can be used by APIs.  This is done so that API providers can&#8217;t change the details of the plan
out from underneath the client app developers who are using it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_apis"><a class="anchor" href="#_apis"></a>APIs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An API represents an external API that is being governed by the API management system.  An API consists
of a set of metadata including name and description as well as an external endpoint defining the API
implementation. The external API implementation endpoint includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The type/protocol of the endpoint (e.g. REST or SOAP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The endpoint content type (e.g. XML or JSON)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The endpoint location (URL) so that the API can be properly proxied to at runtime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, policies can be configured on an API. Typically, the policies applied to APIs are things
like authentication, or caching.  Any policies configured on API will be applied at runtime regardless of the
client app and API contract.  This is why authentication is a common policy to configure at the API
level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>APIs may be offered through one or more plans configured in the same organization. When plans are used,
API consumers (client apps) must consume the API through one of those plans. Please see the section on
'API Contracts' for more information.  Alternatively, an API can simply be marked as "Public", in which
case any client may access the API&#8217;s managed endpoint without providing an API Key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only once an API is fully configured, including its policies, implementation, and plans can it be
published to the Gateway for consumption by client apps.  Once an API has been published, it can only
be changed if it is a "Public" API.  APIs that are offered via Plans are immutable - to change them
you must create a new version.  The reason for this is that API consumers may have created Contracts
with your API, through your Plan.  When they do this, they must agree to some terms and conditions.
It is therefore understood that the terms to which they are agreeing will not change.  However, for
Public APIs, there is no such agreement.  For this reason, you can make changes to Public APIs and
re-publish them at any time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_client_apps"><a class="anchor" href="#_client_apps"></a>Client Apps</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A client app represents a consumer of an API. Typical API consumers are things like mobile applications and
B2B applications. Regardless of the actual implementation, a client app must be added to the
API management system so that Contracts can be created between it and the APIs it wishes to consume.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A client app consists of basic metadata such as name and description.  Policies can also be configured on
a client app, but are optional.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, API Contracts can be created between a client app and the API(s) it wishes to consume.
Once the API Contracts are created, the client app can be registered with the runtime gateway.  Policies
and Contracts can be added/removed at any time.  However, after any changes are made, you must
re-register the client app.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_api_contracts"><a class="anchor" href="#_api_contracts"></a>API Contracts</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An API contract is simply a link between a Client App and an API through a plan offered by that
API. This is the only way that a client app can consume an API. If there are no client apps that
have created API contracts with an API, that API cannot be accessed through the API management
runtime gateway (unless of course the API is "Public").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an API Contract is created, the system generates a unique API key specific to that contract. All
requests made to the API by a Client App through the API Gateway must include this API key. The API
key is used to create the runtime policy chain from the policies configured on the API, plan, and
client app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>API Contracts can only be created between Client Apps and published APIs which are offered through
at least one Plan.  An API Contract cannot be created between a Client App and a Public API.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_policy_chain"><a class="anchor" href="#_policy_chain"></a>Policy Chain</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A policy chain is an ordered sequence of policies that are applied when a request is made for an API
through the API Gateway. The order that policies are applied is important and is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Client App</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>API</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within these individual sections, the end user can specify the order of the policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a request for an API is received by the API Gateway the policy chain is applied to the request in
the order listed above. If none of the policies fail, the API Gateway will proxy the request to the backend
API implementation.  Once a response is received from the back end API implementation, the policy chain is
then applied in reverse order to that response. This allows each policy to be applied twice, once to the
inbound request and then again to the outbound response.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_user_management"><a class="anchor" href="#_user_management"></a>User Management</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The API Manager offers user role capabilities at the organization level. Users can be members of
organizations and have specific roles within those organizations. The roles themselves are configurable by
an administrator, and each role provides the user with a set of permissions that determine what actions the
user can take within an organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_new_users"><a class="anchor" href="#_new_users"></a>New Users</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users must self register with the management UI in order to be given access to an organization or to
create their own organization. In some configurations it is possible that user self registration is
unavailable and instead user information is provided by a standard source of identity such as LDAP.  In
either case, the actions a user can take are determined by that user&#8217;s role memberships within the context
of an organization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_membership"><a class="anchor" href="#_membership"></a>Membership</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users can be members of organizations. All memberships in an organization include the specific roles the
user is granted. It is typically up to the owner of an organization to grant role memberships to the members
of that organization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_roles"><a class="anchor" href="#_roles"></a>Roles</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Roles determine the capabilities granted a user within the context of the organization. The roles themselves
and the capabilities that those roles grant are configured by system administrators. For example,
administrators would typically configure the following roles:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organization Owner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>API Developer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client App Developer</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of these roles is configured by an administrator to provide a specific set of permissions allowing the
user to perform relevant actions appropriate to that role. For example the Client App Developer role would
grant an end user the ability to manage client apps and API contracts for those client apps. However
that user would not be able to create or manage the organization&#8217;s APIs or plans.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_managing_organizations"><a class="anchor" href="#_managing_organizations"></a>Managing Organizations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before any other actions can be taken an organization must exist. All other operations take place within the
context of an organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to create an organization click the 'Create a New Organization' link found on the dashboard page
that appears when you first login. Simply provide an organization name and description and then click the
'Create Organization' button.  If successful you will be taken to the organization details page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you create multiple organizations, you can see the list of those organizations on your home page. For
example, you may click the 'Go to My Organizations' link from the dashboard page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_managing_plans"><a class="anchor" href="#_managing_plans"></a>Managing Plans</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plans must be managed within the scope of an organization.  Once created, plans can be used for any API
defined within that same organization.  To see a list of existing plans for an organization, navigate to the
'Plans' tab for that organization on its details page.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_creating_a_plan"><a class="anchor" href="#_creating_a_plan"></a>Creating a Plan</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plans can be created easily from the 'Plans' tab of the organization details page. Simply click the 'New Plan'
button and then provide a plan name, version, and description. Once that information is provided, click the
'Create Plan' button. If successfully created, you&#8217;ll be taken to the plan details page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_plan_policies"><a class="anchor" href="#_plan_policies"></a>Plan Policies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you switch to the 'Policies' tab on the plan details page you can configure the list of policies for the
plan. Please note that the order of the policies can be changed and is important. The order that the policies
appear in the user interface determines the order they will be applied at runtime. You can drag a policy up
and down the list to change the order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To add a policy to the plan click the 'Add Policy' button. On the resulting page choose the type of policy
you wish to create and then configure the details for that policy. Once you have configured the details click
the 'Add Policy' button to add the policy to the plan.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_locking_the_plan"><a class="anchor" href="#_locking_the_plan"></a>Locking the Plan</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once all your plan policies are added and configured the way you want them, you will need to Lock the
plan.  This can be done from any tab of the Plan UI page.  Locking the plan will prevent all future policy
changes, and make the plan available for use by APIs.</p>

<h3 id="_providing_apis"><a class="anchor" href="#_providing_apis"></a>Providing APIs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A core capability of API management is for end users to create, manage, and configure APIs they wish to
provide. This section explains the steps necessary for users to provide those APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_creating_an_api"><a class="anchor" href="#_creating_an_api"></a>Creating an API</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First the user must create an API within an organization. If an organization does not yet exist one can
easily be created.  See the 'Managing Organizations' section for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the organization details page, navigate to the 'APIs' tab and click on the 'New API' button. You
will be asked to provide an API name, version number, and description.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If successfully created, you will be taken to the API details page. From here you can configure the
details of the API.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_api_implementation"><a class="anchor" href="#_api_implementation"></a>API Implementation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every API must be configured with an API implementation. The implementation indicates the external
API that the API Gateway will proxy to if all the policies are successfully applied. Click the
'Implementation' tab to configure the API endpoint and API type details on your API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 'Implementation' tab is primarily used to configure the details of the back-end API that
apiman will proxy to at runtime.  You must configure the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Endpoint URL</strong> - The URL that apiman will use to proxy a request made for this API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Endpoint Type</strong> - Currently either REST or SOAP (not presently used, future information)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Endpoint Content Type</strong> - Choose between JSON and XML, information primarily used to respond with a policy failure or error in the appropriate format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the 'Implementation' tab allows you to configure any security options that might
be required when proxying requests to the back-end API.  For example, if you are using two-way
SSL to ensure full security between the API Gateway and your back-end API, you may configure
that here.  We also support simple BASIC authentication between the gateway and your back end
API.  Please note that BASIC authentication is not ideal, and especially insecure if not
using SSL/HTTPS to connect to the back end API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the apiman administrator has configured multiple Gateways (see the "System Administration / Gateways"
section below), then the 'Implementation' tab will also include an option that will let
you choose which Gateway(s) to use when publishing.  You may select one or more Gateway
in this case.  If you choose multiple Gateways, then when you click the 'Publish' button,
apiman will publish the API to <strong>all</strong> of the selected Gateways.</p>

<h4 id="_api_definition"><a class="anchor" href="#_api_definition"></a>API Definition</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a provider of an API, it is best to include as much information about the API as possible, so
that consumers can not only create contracts, but also learn how to make calls.  For this purpose, you
can optionally include an API Definition document by adding it to your API on the Definition tab.
Currently the only supported type of definition file is Swagger.  Include a swagger spec document here
so that consumers of your API can browse information about your API directly in the API Manager
UI.</p>

<h4 id="_available_plans"><a class="anchor" href="#_available_plans"></a>Available Plans</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before an API can be consumed by a client app, it must make itself available through at least one of
the organization&#8217;s plans (or it must be marked as "Public"). Marking an API as public or making an API
available through one or more plan can be done by navigating to the 'Plans' tab on the API details page. The
'Plans' tab will list all of the available plans defined by the organization. Simply choose one or more plan
from this list.  If no plans are needed, you can instead mark the API as "Public", making it available to
be consumed anonymously by any client.  Although an API can be <strong>both</strong> Public and available through one or
more plan, it is unusual to do so.</p>

gateway. This can be done from any tab on the API details page by clicking  the 'Publish' button in
the top section of the UI.  If successful, the status of the API will change to "Published" and the
'Publish' button will disappear.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the API has been published, it may or may not be editable depending on whether it is a "Public"
API or not.  For "Public" APIs, you will be able to continue making changes.  After at least one
change is made, you will have the option to "Re-Publish" the API to the Gateway.  Doing so will
update all information about the API in the Gateway.  However, if the API is <strong>not</strong> Public, then
the API will be immutable - therefore in order to make any changes you will need to create a new
version of the API.</p>

<h4 id="_api_metrics"><a class="anchor" href="#_api_metrics"></a>API Metrics</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once an API is published and is being consumed at runtime, metrics information about that usage is
recorded in a metrics storage system.  See the Metrics section of the API Gateway documentation for
more about how and when metrics data is recorded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an API has been used by at least once, then it will have metrics information available.
This information can be viewed in the 'Metrics' tab on the API&#8217;s details page.  On this page
you can choose the type of metric you wish to see (e.g. Usage metrics and Response Type
metrics) as well as a pre-defined time range (e.g. Last 30 Days, Last Week, etc&#8230;&#8203;).</p>

<p>The primary action taken when configuring a client app is the creation of Contracts to APIs. This is
what we mean when we say "consuming an API". There are a number of ways to create API contracts. This
section will describe the most useful of these options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the Client App details page, you can find an API to consume by clicking on the 'Search for APIs to consume'

API you wish to consume.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use the controls on this page to search for an API. Once you have found the API you are interested in,
click on its name in the search results area. This will take you to the API details page for API
consumers. The consumer-oriented API details page presents you with all of the information necessary to
make a decision about how to consume the API. It includes a list of all the API versions and a list
of all of the available plans the API can be consumed through.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that you can click on an individual plan to see the details of the policies that will be enforced should
that plan be chosen. Click on the 'Create Contract' button next to the plan you wish to use when consuming
this API. You will be taken to the new contract page to confirm that you want to create an API
contract to this API through the selected plan. If you are sure this is the API contract you wish to
create, click the 'Create Contract' button and then agree to the terms and conditions. If successful, you
will be taken to the 'Contracts' tab on the client app details page.</p>

For example, as an API implementation evolves, the policies associated with it in the API Manager
may need to change.  Versioning allows this to happen, by providing a way for a user to create a new
version of a particular API (or Client App or Plan) and then making changes to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a new version of an entity, view the details of the entity and click the "New Version" button
